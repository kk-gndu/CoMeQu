# CoMeQu
for better commit messages

## Getting Started


Communication in a software project team is very important for understanding its past, and predicting its future. Distributed teams work in different time zones, and have members from different cultures. Along with this, there is a lot of diversity in the developer community (particularly in OSS projects) as far as their education and experience are concerned. Therefore, written communication is an important medium for exchange of information among the team members. 

### A Good Commit Message
Commit messages, if written in a proper way, can serve as important means of written communication. A good commit message should explain what and why a code change was introduced. However, it has been observed that commit messages generally lack any information. Furthermore, if a commit message carries any information, it is about how the change was implemented rather than explaining what and why.

Taking cognizance of the role of commit messages in team work, improving the commit messages to convey more meaning and information becomes imperative.  

CoMeQu is a project which can assist developers in writing meaningful messages.
